## Are there communities of third-parties in disinformation and non-disisnformation websites?

### DATA

The data I added here is different from the one I mentioned previously (different experiment, different bots). I think we can start here and I will prepare the other data (finding the main cookies company can take some time). 

In this data we have:

- ONLY two types of bots: 1. Non-disinformation (crawl = "pilot_1_US_base" and 2. Disinformation (crawl = "pilot_1_US_misinfo")
- Each type of bot visited 500 websites and collected all cookies. 


I started a notebook (data_notebook) where you can find the DB and some discription of the most important columns.
